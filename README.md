London Bike Sharing Analysis
London Bike Sharing Analysis â€“ Data Processing & Visualization for Smarter Mobility Insights

This project provides a data-driven understanding of Londonâ€™s bike-sharing trends by integrating Python for data cleaning and Tableau for visualization. Using a Kaggle dataset, I identified missing values, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies, ensuring a clean and reliable dataset for analysis.

Project Highlights:
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Used Pandas & NumPy in Jupyter to handle missing values, optimize data structure, and convert the dataset into a CSV for seamless Tableau integration.

  - Comprehensive Tableau Dashboard â€“ Added dimensions like season, time, weather, and moving average period, and measures such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, ride count, and holiday/weekend impact.

  - Ride Pattern Analysis â€“ Identified trends in peak usage months (max/min), seasonal demand shifts, and weather conditions affecting bike rentals.

  - Moving Averages for Smarter Forecasting â€“ Implemented ride count moving averages to smooth fluctuations and predict future demand.

What makes this project unique? By combining Pythonâ€™s data processing power with Tableauâ€™s visualization capabilities, I created an end-to-end analytics pipeline that transforms raw data into actionable insights for urban mobility improvements. ðŸš²âœ¨
